# EDX-Center

This is my portfolio website. It contains details to my repositories, social media and ways to communicate!
Thank you for checking out my website!

My TestBench | PracticeGround | LearningRoom, Knowledge Management Center project.
This repository was created as part of my "TestBench/PracticeGround/LearningRoom" series of projects for various languages whereby I create a repository like this to practice new topics, plan new ideas and implement + test them so as to learn.

Every topic/tests is bound to a button -> What this means is that every function I create or every plan I made and implement is allocated/assigned to a button that is placed under a subgroup (you may refer to my project 'Autoref' for an idea of how this works)
    - By doing so, I hope to make referring to function codes or looking back at ideas easier as
    - All you have to do is select a button and refer to the codes inside

If you have any ideas, feedbacks or just want to reach out to me, feel free to find me in one of the contacts below!

Thank you :)
